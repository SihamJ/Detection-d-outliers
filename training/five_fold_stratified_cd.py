# Description: Implementation of five-fold stratified cross-validation
# Divide the data set into five random groups. Make sure
# that the proportion of each class in each group is roughly equal to its
# proportion in the entire data set.

# Required Data Set Format for Classification Problems:
# Columns (0 through N)
# 0: Class
# 1: Attribute 1
# 2: Attribute 2
# 3: Attribute 3
# ...
# N: Attribute N
